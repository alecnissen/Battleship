// create player
// Players can take turns playing the game by attacking the enemy Gameboard.
// The game is played against the computer, so make the ‘computer’ capable of making random plays. 
// The AI does not have to be smart, but it should know whether or not a given move is legal. (i.e. it shouldn’t shoot the same coordinate twice). 


// make a player factory function.
// that makes a player for the game 
// make a computer 
// comp should know if move is legal and cannot hit the same square twice. 

// what properties would player have? 
// a way to track whose turn it is 
// a name
// I would say a name property and a way to measure turns 
// same thing for the comp function, 
// 

// function createPlayer(name, turn) { 

// }
