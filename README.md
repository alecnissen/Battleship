<h1>About This Project</h1> 
This project was part of The Odin Project's course. It was the final JavaScript project before the ReactJS section. This project was extremtly challening and I developed a lot of grit and fortitude finishing this project. Biggest concepts on this project would be using modules, unit testing using Jest, OOP principles. 

<br> 

<h1>What I learned</h1>
    <ul>
    <li>How to write unit test with test and TDD best practices</li>
    <li>Using Factory functions to create player objects</li>
    <li>Using function methods such as attack function, determing if coordinates were a hit or miss, and determing if a ship was sunk</li>
    <li>Drag and drop ship objects onto the gameboard</li>
    <li>Allowing the computer to make random attacks, while also making sure it does not hit the same cell twice</li>
    <li>Making sure that when user or computer places their ships that placement is valid, and not off the board</li>
    <li>Organzing code into modules for good code structure and organization</li>
    </ul>

<h1>Getting Started</h1>

To get project cloned locally: git clone git@github.com:alecnissen/Battleship.git

then ``` npm install ``` which will install all dependency's and packages.

<h1>Features</h1>

-Users can drag the ship objects onto the board. 

-Unit tests and TDD to ensure code works as intended and to minimize errors and unwanted behavior. 

-When a hit is hit, color will change to red, and a miss will be colored blue 

-Code organized into modules for organization and structure
